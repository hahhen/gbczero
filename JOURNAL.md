This is my journal of the design and building process of **Gameboy Color Zero**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/251).


## 10/6/2025 - Researched what I'd need for the project.  

To build my project, I need:

- A Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (got it)
- A Gameboy Color shell
- The PCB for button input & its electronic components
- A 2.8" SPI LCD Screen
- A LiPo 3.7V 2000-2500mAh battery
- An Adafruit Powerboost 1000c OR a TP4056 module + 5V boost converter
- A 23mm speaker
- A speaker amplifier PAM 8403 module
- Soldering Iron
- Solder
- Wires!
- A flush cutter or dremel to cut the GBC shell's plastic pieces that might get in the way

## 10/13/2025 - Began the schematic  

Researched and learned a bit about PCB making. Made this so far, not sure if everything is correct.
I'll continue to make the schematic until it's finished to begin making the PCB, as I learned I should do.

Decided to dump the Adafruit Powerboost 1000c to reduce costs

## 10/14/2025 - Continued the schematic (and fixed my laptop)

Added ground to the switches and and added the TP4056 module and battery, but I'm still working on it.
Still don't quite understand how to connect everything right, but I'll make it. It's a gift for a girl i like.

(I had a problem with my laptop and had to fix it also, but it's working fine now :D)

## 10/16/2025 - Changed power components.  

Changed charging component from TP4056 to a MCP73833T-AMI_MF to support battery life information. Also changed my boost converter for a TPS61030 to support LBO. I'm not sure if the connections are right, but I'll check later. I'll also add a DAC for better audio.

## 10/17/2025 - MOre shematics yayyy  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjgzMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6870a9f94adeccd2b0ce1f05730733f341dcd0cb/image.png)

I kinda am finishing the power system, though i'm not sure if my connections are all right. Just discovrered that there is a simulator in kicad, WILL be useful. As you can probalby guess i'm super tired and not writing right, but basically what i thought of::

led for charging
another led, rgb, going to be white when on (idle) and red/orange when low battery. charging->low battery->idle is the hierarchy, only one at a time. will need to use logic gates, but i'm kinda experienced. i'll prob talk to my professor he'll lovethis project and will help me yayuy;;

k bay
